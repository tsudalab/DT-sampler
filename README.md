## Abstract

DT-sampler is an ensemble model based on decision tree sampling. Different from random forest, DT-sampler uniformly samples decision trees from a given space, which can generate more stable results and provide higher interpretability compared to random forest. DT-sampler only has two key parameters: #node and threshold. #node constrains the size of decision trees generated by DT-sampler and threshold ensures a minimum training accuracy for each decision tree.

① Encode the construction of decision trees as a SAT problem. \
② Utilize SAT sampler to uniformly sample multiple satisfiable solutions from the high accuracy space.\
③ Decode the satisfiable solutions back into decision trees.\
④ Estimate the training accuracy distribution of the decision trees in the high accuracy space.\
⑤ Measure feature importance by calculating the emergence probability  of each feature.
