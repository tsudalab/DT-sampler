### DT-sampler
DT-sampler is an ensemble model based on decision tree sampling. Different from random forest, DT-sampler uniformly samples decision trees from a given space, which can generate more stable results and provide higher interpretability compared to random forest. DT-sampler only has two key parameters: #node and threshold. #node constrains the size of decision trees generated by DT-sampler and threshold ensures a minimum training accuracy for each decision tree.
